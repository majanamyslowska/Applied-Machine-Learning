# Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods
An implementation of decision trees and ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting using Python. The project explores classification using the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm, emphasizing the optimization of split points using squared-loss minimization. The included notebooks guide users through implementing the decision tree from scratch, applying it to binary classification problems with various datasets like ION and artificially generated spiral data. Further, the project extends to ensemble techniques, including random forests and Adaboost, to improve prediction robustness and accuracy.

Technical Concepts:
- Decision tree development using CART for binary classification.
- Techniques for handling overfitting via ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting.
- Performance optimization using numpy for efficient array manipulations and mathematical operations.
- Use of matplotlib for visualization of decision boundaries and error analysis.
- Implementation details include recursive tree building, feature and threshold selection for splits, and integration of ensemble predictions.

# Efficient Decision Tree Operations
Focus on optimizing the computation of decision trees for large datasets. It includes an efficient implementation of the CART algorithm and provides tools for evaluating the decision tree's performance using pre-computed unique point hashes to avoid redundant calculations. The project is designed to handle extensive datasets efficiently, minimizing computation time without sacrificing accuracy, suitable for real-time data processing applications.

Technical Concepts:
- Advanced numpy techniques for data manipulation and performance enhancement.
- Optimization of decision tree evaluation by reducing redundant calculations through unique data point identification.
- Detailed implementation of custom recursive functions for tree construction and querying.
- Profiling and optimization of Python code to achieve improvements in execution time for both tree construction and evaluation.
